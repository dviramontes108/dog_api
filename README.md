## Note :information_source:

- I didn't spend a fair amount of time to make better structure as well as clean code, and I just focused to show my coding style. I hope you understand this point as I totally agree that there are still many parts should be improved including folder/file structure, etc. Thanks for reviewing my assessment result! :heart:
